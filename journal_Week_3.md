# Notes I took and thinks I want to remember:

Brainstorming: Most people dont do it pretty well. //So true!

## Understand the problem
Sometimes, the problem you need to address is not the one you originally set out to tackle.
Actual problem is always broader than it seems
Always look a the context

## Involve Users
often refered to as human-centered design.
Testing and protyping for them and their needs
INterviewing them. (Quality and quantitiy)

## Developing solutions
Most people know this as Brainstorming
No criticism.
Throw everything at the table.
Sort out later

## Prototype and test. Repeat.

## Implementation
before we have to find the best solution and then we can implement it
Most of the time and money will be spend Here

## Think big
Can be applied to any problem. Not only products
Schools are implementing DT
IBM is training its design thinking principles to their employees

In short:
First: Fully understand the problem.
Second: Explore a wide range of possibile solutions.
Third: Iterate extensively through prototyping and testing.
Forth: Implement through the customary deployment mechanisms.

# Design Thinking in general

As a trained Service Designer and I gained a pretty good hands on knowldge
about Design Thinking. Actually the reason why I started to study design was
triggerd by an article by IDEO and how they try to solve problems that seem
impossible to. After nearly three years of studying Integrated Design my mindset
changed a lot but I am still convinced that Design Thinking is a very helpful tool
in any different industries and areas of expertise.

But I also noticed that all of a sudden there are design thinking departments popping out in every kind
of enterprise. The Question is: Do we really need Design Thinking? The practice behind Design thinking is actually
not very new. As Peter Merholz already said in his article "Why Design Thinking Wont save us", these practices have already
been used in methods from anthropology and sociology. Tim Brown simply renamed it and used these techniques in a network
context.

# Smart = !Intelligence
To define the term smart is not any easy task:
On the one hand, the Smart can be seen as a broad development of the knowledge economy in an economic region.
On the other hand I could just be seen as an integration of connected computers that builds up a network to controll
our environemnt. As Norbert Wiener would call it: Cybernetisation!
