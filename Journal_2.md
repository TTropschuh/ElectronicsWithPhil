# Journal Week 2

### Main Studio/Lab Undergrad Junior Year

#### Emerging Technologies.

In this course we focus on different technologies and the resulting changes that we are facing in the future. My topic in detail is _Quantum Computing_ which has a huge impact on nearly every area where technology is involved.
To visualize the impacts of quantum computing I am currently working on a website that should inform about quantum computing and show different dystopian/utopain scenarios. The interface is inspired by electronic "smart" devices like Alexa and other IOT products. The only way to interact with the website is a search bar and should imitate a kind of chat bot style.
In one of the scenarios I try to work with an API that pulls data from a website and connects these with sensor data which I store on my own server. However, I am not planning to combine this class with my main Lab but I can definitely use the technical knowledge that I gain here.
I would much rather make a unique project just for this course. I am very interested urban data and for us invisible things that can, with sensory help be made visible.
Arduino is not very long around but since it is easy accessible (thanks to the WWW) the community is growing every day.

### My experiences with physical computing

What is very annoying to me about Arduino in general that it just breaks after a certain time. For example: I tried to build a lamp that can be triggered via an app on my phone. It works perfect but after a week or less I have to reset the arudino. Otherwise it will just turn off.
Resume: To build things properly Arduino is the wrong tool. It is more for prototyping.

### My goals of this class
This is why I want to gain more knowledge about electronics in general! The years before I just copy-pasted code and followed very clear instructions which I found on the internet. But if I want to make unique projects it is very unlikely that I find a proper code online. I want to be more Independent.

### Making things smart

What does it mean if something is "smart"?
Well, there are a few definitions flying around but in general we could say that you can call any device "smart" that is somehow connected to a network of other devices that have a protocol to get feedback from each other.
But do we really need to connect every device we own to the _cloud_? And what about security reasons.

I found a very interesting article that I would love to share.
