ical computing

What is very annoying to me about Arduino in general that it just breaks after a certain time. For example: I tried to build a lamp that can be triggered via an app on my phone. It works perfect but after a week or less I have to reset the arudino. Otherwise it will just turn off.
Resume: To build things properly Arduino is the wrong tool. It is more for prototyping.

### My goals of this class
This is why I want to gain more knowledge about electronics in general! The years before I just copy-pasted code and followed very clear instructions which I found on the internet. But if I want to make unique projects it is very unlikely that I find a proper code online. I want to be more Independent.

### Making things smart

What does it mean if something is "smart"?
Well, there are a few definitions flying around but in general we could say that you can call any device "smart" that is somehow connected to a network of other devices that have a protocol to get feedback from each other.
But do we really need to connect every device we own to the _cloud_? And what about security reasons.

I found a very interesting article that I would love to share.
