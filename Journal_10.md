# Journal Week 10

Develop concept for Final.
Use some ideas from class discussion on the notion of "Smart Worlds".

As I didn't really finalize my Mid Term project I would love to continue. Just a little summary of what the whole idea is about:

I want to measure the _invisible_ in an urban context and visualize electromagnetic fields. To visualize the data I prefer to work in an analog way. For example: Light Painting.
As I have shown in my previous midterm documentation I would like to orient on the project Immaterials from Blabla and balbal. The way of visualization has the big advantage of presenting the measured data in a certain geographical context which people can more refer to compared to at normal map from a bird's perspective.

The previous idea was to measure sound, but I stumbled onto this great and very simple [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-EMF-Detector/) which shows how you can build one of the measurement tools with just a simple piece of metal, a resistor, and an Arduino. But for my application, I will make it a little more complex.

I want to build a device that is only measuring when I press a button. If the button is pressed the certain values get mapped to a LED strip. With a one-second delay, the strip should now do this mapping five times in a row. The one-second gives me the time to move the stripe from one place to the other. In addition, it would be nice to have a little seven-segment display which will show the measured values. This will be great for any debugging that will defiantly be a big part of this project.
I also have to think about an external power supply. In this case I will work with a conventional power bank.

### The Shape

The shape of the device should be stick-shaped and approximetly half a meter long. Here are some ideas how some outcomes could look like.
