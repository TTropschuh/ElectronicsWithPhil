# Assignment Two

## Circuits in general

What is a circuit? BAsically it is a path that return to the beginning. If this is not the case, I'm gonna have a problem.
Cool term I found: "Knife Switches". Opening and closing a circuit with a cooper plate pushing into the socket.

Things a circuit needs:
- Insulation --> prevents unintended connections between parts of the circuit.
- Load --> where the energy is converted into work. It is also sometimes called the "sink".
- Source --> Provides the electromotive source.

## Series circuit

The parts of a simple circuit are all connected in series, but the series circuit has more components than the simple circuit, having multiple loads, and sometimes multiple sources.

Example: touch.


## Parallel circuit
## Switch built from a novel material
