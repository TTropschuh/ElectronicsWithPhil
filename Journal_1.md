# The Image Fulgurator

The Image Fulgurator, what means Flasher in latin, is a device what projects, fist unseen images on physical objects. The projected picture can only be made visible with the help of a flashing camera.

## How does it work?
This device makes it possible to apply any motif to objects that are photographed with a standard camera and flash - initially unnoticed by the photographer.
It consists of a flash light and a modified camera whose lens is used as a projection lens. The flash, together with a template containing the subject to be projected, a gobo (or developed slide film), is placed where the film plane of the camera normally is. The device uses a sensor to detect the triggering of the photographer's photo flash and reacts with its own flash (function similar to that of an optically triggered unleashed flash or daughter flash), which projects the subject onto the target object through the template. The flash of the Image Fulgurator is triggered so quickly that the projected subject is captured by the photographer's camera through the camera shutter which is only briefly open - while the eyes of those present are so distracted by the photographer's flash alone that the projection remains inconspicuous on site.

During a speech by US President Barack Obama, von Bismarck projected a cross on the President's lectern. Photographs by Klaus Wowereit show the mayor of Berlin with the logo of the mobile phone provider O2 on his lapel.
